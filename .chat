about DB{
        // NodeJS provides MANY MANY modules, like this one 'mysql', u just run a command to install it 'npm install mysql'
        // here i created the connection, as u see
        // This is the DB connection file
        //okay I take it back, you're not messy
        // Am not in codes :3
        //and you were saying that c# is weird??
        // It removes a whoooole word
        // Keep holding it and press 
        // WHAT ARE U DOING XDD
        //Idk XD doing AS U ASKED, IT DOESN'T WORK THEN, it is for me
        // However, let me show u around!!
        //OKII DOKII

        // Here it just selects a databse, i had a weird error, and this fixed it

        // a good practice of JS, is make each function or method, do only one task, so am implementing that here, kinda xD
        // This created a table for me, but it was useless xD
        //WHY??
        // Somehow, when i call it, ygouli 'Syntax error', and am sure it is not, i tried it and printed the query in the console
        // But it didn't work, and i excuted the same query, manually on mysql command line and worked normally -_-
        // And this one, inserts a dairy! And u tell me my code it orgnised while this function doesn't belong here 
        // {...args} this means i can insert as many arguments in that object as i want :3
        // Hello ?? xD
        //sorry, I got interrupted...sooo, excute it
        // Sure !! Just a sec ok
